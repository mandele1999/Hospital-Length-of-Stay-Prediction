# 🏥Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict the length of hospital stays for admitted patients based on patient data.

## 📜 Project Overview

Hospital resource management is critical in ensuring efficient patient care. This project aims to predict the length of hospital stays using machine learning models based on patient demographics, admission type, and medical conditions. Hospitals can improve bed allocation, reduce wait times, and optimize resources by providing accurate stay predictions.
